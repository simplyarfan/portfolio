  "about": "I build things that think. I'm a 22-year-old AI/ML Engineer at SecureMax Technologies, where I design and deploy smart systems that bridge machine learning, full-stack development, and cloud infrastructure. I graduated from the American University of Sharjah in June 2025 with a degree in Computer Engineering, and since then I've been obsessed with creating solutions that actually do something â€” from internal AI tools to full-scale automation pipelines. My work lives at the intersection of AI, cloud, and robotics. I spend most of my time experimenting with new frameworks, integrating tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral, and constantly refining how systems learn, scale, and interact. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll usually find me building side projects for fun, customizing setups on Vercel or Azure, or breaking and fixing my own deployments just to understand them better. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new tech and gaming competitively. Born on July 12, 2003, I'm passionate about innovation and love the colors maroon and black.",
